# Run 15.6: Launch Readiness & Go/No-Go Decision

## Overview

Run 15.6 provides a comprehensive framework for assessing the Insurance Lead Generation AI Platform's readiness for production launch. This document defines the criteria, checks, and decision-making process for a Go/No-Go launch decision.

## Objectives

1. **Assess Production Readiness** - Verify all systems are operational and meet production standards
2. **Identify Risks** - Surface any potential issues that could impact launch
3. **Define Success Criteria** - Establish clear metrics for launch success
4. **Create Decision Framework** - Provide structured Go/No-Go criteria
5. **Document Rollback Plan** - Ensure we can revert if issues arise

## Launch Decision Timeline

```
T-2 Weeks: Initial Readiness Assessment
T-1 Week:  Pre-Launch Verification
T-3 Days: Final Go/No-Go Review
T-1 Day:  Launch Execution Preparation
T-0:      LAUNCH
```

### Risk Response

- **Accept**: Low probability, low impact risks
- **Mitigate**: High probability or high impact risks - must have mitigation plans
- **Avoid**: Critical risks with insufficient mitigation = NO-GO

## Rollback Plan

### Rollback Triggers

- System availability drops below 95% for 30 minutes
- Error rate exceeds 5% for 15 minutes
- Data corruption detected
- Security breach confirmed
- Critical bug blocking core functionality

### Rollback Procedure

1. **Immediate Actions (0-5 minutes)**
   - Identify the issue
   - Declare incident
   - Alert on-call team
   - Begin rollback process

2. **Rollback Execution (5-15 minutes)**
   ```bash
   # Identify previous stable version
   kubectl rollout history deployment/api

   # Rollback to previous stable version
   kubectl rollout undo deployment/api --to-revision=42

   # Rollback database schema (if needed)
   # Use migration rollback scripts

   # Verify all services are healthy
   kubectl get pods -l app=insurance-platform
   ```

3. **Post-Rollback (15-30 minutes)**
   - Verify system health
   - Check data integrity
   - Notify stakeholders
   - Document incident
   - Schedule root cause analysis

4. **Recovery (30-60 minutes)**
   - Fix the underlying issue
   - Test fix in staging
   - Prepare new deployment
   - Schedule relaunch

### Rollback Success Criteria
