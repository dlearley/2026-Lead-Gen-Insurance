# Why Shared Leads are Killing Your Agency’s Profitability

In the fast-paced world of insurance sales, the old adage "the early bird gets the worm" has never been more relevant. However, if you're buying shared leads from traditional aggregators, you're not just competing against the clock—you're competing against five other agencies for the exact same worm.

## The Shared Lead Trap

For years, shared leads were the bread and butter of agency growth. They were cheap, plentiful, and easy to acquire. But as the market has matured, the "shared" model has become a race to the bottom. Here's why:

1. **Instant Price Shopping**: When a prospect is sold to multiple agencies, the conversation immediately shifts to price. You aren't being sold as a trusted advisor; you're being compared on a spreadsheet.
2. **The "Speed to Lead" Nightmare**: If you don't call the lead within the first 60 seconds, someone else will. This creates a high-stress environment for agents and often leads to poor customer experiences.
3. **Consumer Fatigue**: By the time you reach the prospect, they've already received three calls and two texts. They are already annoyed before they even hear your name.

## The Exclusive Advantage

Contrast this with **exclusive, high-intent leads**. When a prospect is generated specifically for your agency, the dynamic changes:

- **Authority and Trust**: You are the only one calling. You have the time to build rapport and understand their specific needs.
- **Higher Conversion**: Exclusive leads typically convert at a 3x to 5x higher rate than shared leads.
- **Lower CPA in the Long Run**: While the cost per lead (CPL) may be higher upfront, the cost per acquisition (CPA) is often lower because you are closing more of them.

## Taking Control of Your Growth

The most successful agencies are moving away from the "lead store" model and building their own growth engines. By using platforms that generate and qualify leads in real-time, specifically for your brand, you take control of the entire customer journey.

Stop fighting for scraps. Build a business based on exclusive relationships and watch your profitability soar.
