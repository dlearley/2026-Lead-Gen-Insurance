## Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

Our platform is best suited for insurance agencies that meet the following criteria:

### 1. Firmographics
- **Industry**: P&C, Health, Life, or Commercial Insurance.
- **Agency Size**: 5 - 50 agents (Small to Mid-sized Agencies).
- **Location**: North America (Initial focus).
- **Revenue**: $1M - $10M Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR).

### 2. Technographics
- Use a CRM (e.g., Salesforce, HubSpot, AgencyBloc).
- Already spending $2k+/month on lead generation (Google Ads, Facebook, aggregators).
- Looking for automation to replace manual processes.

### 3. Psychographics
- Growth-oriented mindset.
- Early adopters of technology.
- Value data-driven decision-making.

## Targeting Strategy

### Tier 1: The "Perfect Fit"
- Agencies with 10+ agents currently using outdated lead aggregators and feeling the "lead quality" pain.
- Target Persona: Agency Owner or Managing Partner.

### Tier 2: The "High Growth"
- New, well-funded agencies looking to scale rapidly and build their tech stack from the ground up.
- Target Persona: Founder.

### Tier 3: The "Modernizer"
- Established agencies with a large book of business but low automation, looking to modernize for retention and cross-selling.
- Target Persona: Operations Manager or Owner.

## Negative Personas (Who we DON'T target)
- Solo agents with no budget for technology.
- Massive carriers (unless for a specific regional pilot).
- Agencies without any digital presence or desire to use a CRM.
