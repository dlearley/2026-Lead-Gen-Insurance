# P&C Insurance Playbook

## Industry Overview
Property & Casualty (P&C) is highly competitive with frequent touchpoints. Lead volume is usually high, but margins can be thin, making efficiency critical.

## Key Pain Points
- **Price Sensitivity**: Customers often shop solely on price.
- **High Churn**: Need for constant new lead inflow to maintain book size.
- **Multitasking**: Agents handling auto, home, and umbrella simultaneously.

## How We Win
- **Speed to Lead**: In P&C, the first agent to call wins 60% of the time. Our real-time distribution is the differentiator.
- **Bundle Optimization**: Use AI to identify leads that are likely to bundle (Home + Auto), increasing the Lifetime Value (LTV).

## Sample Talk Track
"I know in P&C you're often fighting over the same $500 premium. What if you could be the only agent calling a prospect who just searched for a home quote, and you reached them while they were still on your website? That's the power of our exclusive real-time leads."
