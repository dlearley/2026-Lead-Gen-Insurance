# Health Insurance Playbook

## Industry Overview
Health insurance is highly seasonal, dominated by Open Enrollment Periods (OEP) and Medicare Annual Enrollment Periods (AEP).

## Key Pain Points
- **Seasonal Burnout**: Agents overwhelmed for 3 months, then "bored" for 9.
- **Compliance**: Strict regulations on how leads are contacted (TCPA/CMS).
- **Complex Products**: Requires high-level qualification to match the right plan.

## How We Win
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Our platform can handle 10x lead volume during OEP without breaking a sweat.
- **Automated Compliance**: Built-in TCPA consent tracking and recording links.
- **Pre-Qualification**: Use AI to ask the first 3-5 health-related questions before the agent even picks up the phone.

## Sample Talk Track
"Open Enrollment is coming. Are you going to have your agents manually dialing through spreadsheets, or are you going to feed them high-intent, pre-qualified leads directly into their CRM so they can focus on enrollments? We help you maximize your most profitable 90 days of the year."
