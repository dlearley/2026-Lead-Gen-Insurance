# Sales Conversation Frameworks

Standardized talk tracks for different stages of the sales cycle.

## 1. Discovery Call (15-20 mins)

### Opening
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from the Lead Gen Platform. I noticed you're growing your team in [Location], and I wanted to see how you're currently handling lead distribution for your new agents?"

### Discovery Questions
- "How many leads are your agents currently working on weekly?"
- "What's your current lead-to-close ratio?"
- "Where are your leads currently coming from (aggregators, self-generated, organic)?"
- "What's the biggest bottleneck in your current sales process?"

### The Gap
"It sounds like you're spending a lot on leads, but your agents are struggling with the follow-up speed. If we could automate that first contact and ensure leads are distributed based on agent performance, how would that impact your numbers?"

## 2. Product Demo (45 mins)

### Introduction
Focus on the specific pain points identified in discovery.

### Key Demo Pillars
1. **Lead Intake**: How we capture high-intent leads.
2. **The AI Engine**: How we qualify and score leads automatically.
3. **Distribution**: How leads get to the right agent instantly.
4. **Analytics**: How you see exactly what's working.

### Handling Objections
- **"It's too expensive"**: Focus on ROI. "If this increases your conversion rate by just 2%, the platform pays for itself in month one. Let's look at the calculator."
- **"We already have a lead provider"**: "We don't necessarily replace them; we make them better. We can ingest those leads and ensure they actually get worked properly."
- **"Our agents won't use it"**: "It integrates directly into their existing CRM. They don't have to change where they work."

## 3. Closing Call

### Confirming Value
"Based on our demo, we saw how the platform can save your agents 10 hours a week on manual follow-up. Does that still align with your goals for this quarter?"

### The Close
"We're ready to start the implementation on Monday. I've sent over the agreement for your signature. Do you have any final questions before we kick things off?"
