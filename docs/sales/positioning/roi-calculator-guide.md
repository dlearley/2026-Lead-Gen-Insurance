# ROI Calculator Guide

This guide explains how to use the internal ROI calculator tool to demonstrate value to prospects.

## The Formula

The ROI is calculated based on four primary variables:
1. **Current Monthly Lead Spend** (A)
2. **Current Lead-to-Close Rate** (B)
3. **Average Commission per Policy** (C)
4. **Estimated Performance Lift with Platform** (D) - *Typically 20-50%*

### Calculation:
`New Revenue = (A / Current CPL) * (B * (1 + D)) * C`
`ROI = (New Revenue - Platform Cost) / Platform Cost`

## Example Scenario

- **Current Spend**: $5,000 / month
- **Current CPL**: $50 (100 leads)
- **Current Conversion**: 5% (5 policies)
- **Avg Commission**: $800
- **Current Revenue**: $4,000 (Losing money on leads!)

- **With Platform (30% Lift)**:
- **New Conversion**: 6.5% (6.5 policies)
- **New Revenue**: $5,200
- **Platform Cost**: $999
- **Net Gain**: $1,200 (Now profitable)

## How to Present This
1. **Ask for their numbers first**: "What are you currently paying for a lead, and what's your team's closing rate?"
2. **Plug them in live**: Use the Excel/Web tool during the demo.
3. **Focus on the "Breakeven"**: "You only need to close 1.5 more policies per month for this entire platform to be free. Everything after that is pure profit."

## Common Pitfalls
- **Overpromising**: Always stay conservative. Use a 20% lift as the baseline.
- **Ignoring LTV**: Remind them that a policy closed today is worth much more over 5 years of renewals.
- **Forgetting Overhead**: Remind them that agents spent less time on these leads, so they could handle *more* volume without hiring.
