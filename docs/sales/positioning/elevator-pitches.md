# Elevator Pitches

## 15-Second Version (The Hook)
"We help insurance agencies automate their lead generation and follow-up using AI, so they can stop chasing cold leads and focus on closing more policies. On average, our clients see a 30% increase in conversion rates in their first 90 days."

## 1-Minute Version (The Solution)
"Insurance agencies today are struggling with high lead costs and slow follow-up times. We’ve built an AI-powered platform that captures exclusive, high-intent leads and routes them to the right agent in seconds. But we don't just stop at delivery—the platform also handles the automated SMS and email nurture until the lead is ready for a conversation. This means your agents spend 100% of their time talking to qualified prospects, and you get full visibility into your ROI through our analytics dashboard."

## 5-Minute Version (The Story)
"The insurance industry has changed. Buying shared leads from old-school aggregators is a race to the bottom where you're competing with 5 other agents for the same person.

We saw a need for agencies to take control of their own growth. Our platform acts as a complete growth engine. First, it generates exclusive leads specifically for your agency. Second, it uses AI to score those leads based on intent—so you know exactly who is serious and who is just browsing. Third, it integrates directly with your existing CRM to ensure a seamless workflow.

One of our clients, a mid-sized P&C agency, was seeing their contact rates drop as they scaled. By implementing our real-time distribution and automated nurture, they increased their contact rate from 20% to 65% in just two months.

We’re not just a lead provider; we’re a technology partner that helps you scale your agency without exponentially increasing your overhead."
