Mixpanel is used for product analytics and event tracking.

## Use Cases

- Track lead funnel performance
- Build cohorts and trigger downstream automation

## Recommended Approach
- Define a stable event schema and naming conventions
- Attach consistent identities (userId, orgId)
- Avoid sending PII unless required and approved
