# Phone Integration

Phone integrations support click-to-call, call logging, recordings (where permitted), and outcomes.

## Common Providers

- Twilio Voice
- Aircall
- RingCentral

## Recommended Setup

- Configure caller IDs and call routing
- Record calls only where legally allowed and disclosed
- Sync call outcomes (answered/no answer/voicemail) to the lead timeline

## Troubleshooting

- One-way audio: check NAT/SIP configuration and firewall rules
- Missing call logs: verify provider webhooks/callbacks
