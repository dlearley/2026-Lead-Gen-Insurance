- What budget are they working with?
- What are they currently paying?
- What's their target premium?

**A - Authority:**
- Are they the decision maker?
- Who else needs to be involved?
- What's the decision-making process?

**N - Need:**
- What prompted them to look now?
- What coverage gaps do they have?
- What are their specific concerns?

**T - Timeline:**

### Q: How often should I follow up with leads?

**Hot Leads (Score 80-100):**
- Initial outreach: Within 15 minutes
- Follow-up: Every 1-2 days
- Method: Phone, email, and SMS combination

**Warm Leads (Score 60-79):**
